# Zenly Preview (Delayed until Sept. 2023)
We are unable to add AI functionality (basically the whole purpose of the project) because we need OpenAI Credits to use the ChatGPT API. This will likely be fixed by September 2023. No worries, though, we will still make updates for this project, but it won't be functional to auto-complete assignments for awhile... 💔</br>

If you want, though, you can donate me $5+ and I can create a OpenAI account and pay the $5 account fee 😜

# Zenly Limitations
Zenly may not be able to work on these websites: </br>
- https://example.com (Reason: Weird CSS Styling) </br>
- https://github.com (Reason: Security Measures by GitHub) </br>
- https://www.iana.org (Reason: Security Measures by IANA) </br>
You probably will never have to execute Zenly on these websites, ever. This is just a warning if you plan on testng our project.
